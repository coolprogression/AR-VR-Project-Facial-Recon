AR Facial Recognition

A Program designed with Opencv, that can detect and recognize faces.




Sprint 1 

In Sprint 1, We originally intend to start programming in Sprint 1. However, the topic
that we were doing requires some research. In this sprint, we managed to come up with
what our product was suppose to do and how we are suppose to achieve that objective. For the former, 
We managed to get the main goal of project thru our Project Backlog. It is essentially the 
ablity to take photos and store them. Everything was an extension of that goal. We had big ideas originally.
However, we needed to take the time to research them and limit the scope to a regular program. As research regarding the
implementation of your program, We were originally getting familar with Unity. With some research, we decided
to switch to more friendly language and platform for our project. OpenCV allows us to use Python to break down
complicated steps into simpler methods. As for objectives regarding the group, We originally didn't have meeting 
plan at begining. With time, We started using Hangouts to schedule and plan meetings on frequent basis, twice a week.
With all our efforts, we managed to complete our goals for this sprint. Nothing needed to be continued beyond this point.

Sprint 2

In Sprint 2, We finished all our objectives that were required for sprint 1. We now need to start with the functionality
of our program which was mainly taking photos/user information and storing them into a database. With some research, we managed
to our foot into the door of Opencv with partial functionality.  However, we didn't get to complete our objectives in S2. We still
needed to fix some issues with OpenCV. From this Sprint, we still need to fix any issues that concern our program's functionality, including
how it takes and store user information (Photos/Names). We need to continue trying to improve the project so it will be presentable. 

Sprint 3:

In Sprint 3, we needed to finish our storing and scanning functions of programs that were described in our Project Backlog. With some time and
research, We managed to complete the following tasks(generally speaking):
   * Scanning faces
   * Storing user information
   * Matching User with information within that DB

However, we need to update our information of our documentation and go more depth with those methods in the following sprint.

Sprint 4:
In this Sprint, We need to take what we achieved in Sprint 3 and hammer out the specific functions that were described in our Project Backlog(or in the file Sprint 4)
to bring our project to a close. What need to be expanded on(Generally speaking)
 *The Scanning of Images and their format
 *How we can display data for each user
 *(Most Importantly) Improving performance.
From this point on, The project has been completed and is ready to be presented

[Stand Up Meetings]
  Sprint 1
Meeting #1
For the first Scrum Meeting, We
    *established our meeting times
    *established our meeting medium
    *Discussed our project in depth so we understand our goals and main objectives
    * got started researching on project
and for our plans, we decided to :
    * research the specifications of our project and come with concrete goals
    * Look at and Test API
    * Talk twice a week to communicate any new ideas
    * get familar with Unity
Meeting #2
  We completed the following:
     *our research for API ( OpenCV) and not do Unity
     *established talking at least twice a week to communicate our ideas
     *established concerte objectives so we can start programming soon.
 We then plan to do:
     *Start on  implementing general structure of our program
     *Try to keep up more with documentation
Sprint 2
 Meeting #3
    We manage to keep with documentation. However, we didn't get any of general structures
    implemented. We plan to complete the tasks of the Sprint 2 and report back if we need even 
    more time
Meeting #4
    We didn't complete the task, and we need more time to implement the general structure of our program, We
    plan to read a bit more and try to attempt it.
Sprint 3
  Meeting #5
    We discussed that we were going to the actual implementation of our project within this Sprint,
    We plan to get some of the general functions up and running. Also, we talked about a bit about the 
    specific objectives (On Sprint 4) and how they are going to be implemented.
  Meeting #6
     We managed to update our backlogs and finish the general structure of our program. We discussed what we were going to do for 
     the next sprint regarding the objectives mentioned in Meeting #5.  We plan to:
         *implement those objectives
         * try to update more of our backlogs
 Sprint 4
  Meeting #7
      When we met up, We finished implement some of the methods mentioned in Sprint 4 Backlog. All we need to do was implement
      the rest and try to improve the performance of program.
  Meeting #8
      We cleaned up our performance issues with our project, and implemented the rest of it. In this stage, we decided to clean up and
      update our documentation so we can present this project properly.
